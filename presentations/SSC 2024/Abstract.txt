Causal mediation analysis is a popular tool for studying complicated causal dependence between multiple variables. We investigate the extent to which the effect of an exposure, X, on a response, Y, is mediated by a third variable, M. One common approach involves fitting regression models and identifying mediation effects with functions of the regression parameters. Unfortunately, uncertainty quantification for these mediation effects is often non-trivial in even simple settings. Existing methods in the literature rely on intensive computation, and thus tend to be slow. 
We propose an analytical method for obtaining standard errors of estimated mediation effects. We illustrate our method with Monte Carlo studies and analysis of a dataset on adherence to pandemic lockdown measures across 11 countries.
