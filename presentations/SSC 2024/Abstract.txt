Causal mediation analysis is a popular tool for studying complicated causal dependence between multiple variables. We investigate the extent to which the effect of an exposure, X, on a response, Y, is mediated by a third variable, M. One common approach involves fitting some regression models and computing straightforward functions of the estimated coefficients. Unfortunately, uncertainty quantification for these "mediation effects" is non-trivial in even the simplest settings. A popular alternative to these analytical standard error formulas is to use the bootstrap, although selecting a single version is challenging in practice. We present a range of implementation for the bootstrap on a complicated model involving non-linearity and mixed-effects, and illustrate our analysis on a dataset investigating the relationship between trustworthiness of peoples' preferred news source and willingness to adhere to pandemic lockdown mandates.
